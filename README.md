# WIREFRAMING
## Introduction to Wireframing
A wireframe is a low-fidelity, skeletal representation of a user interface (UI) layout. It focuses on the overall structure, information hierarchy, and functionality without getting bogged down in visual details like color or typography. Wireframes are typically created using basic shapes, lines, and text placeholders.
