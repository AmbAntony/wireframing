# WIREFRAMING
## Introduction to Wireframing
A wireframe is a low-fidelity, skeletal representation of a user interface (UI) layout. It focuses on the overall structure, information hierarchy, and functionality without getting bogged down in visual details like color or typography. Wireframes are typically created using basic shapes, lines, and text placeholders.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
Here are the key elements found in a wireframe, with examples of how each contributes to the overall design:

### 1. Layout Structure
#### Definition:
The overall framework or skeletal arrangement of the page’s components—like headers, sidebars, footers, and content areas.

#### Example Contribution:
- A three-column layout (with a sidebar on both sides and content in the center) helps distribute navigation, promotions, and primary content clearly.
- A grid system ensures consistency and balance across all pages.

#### Why It Matters:
It guides visual hierarchy, supports responsive design, and improves usability by aligning content predictably.

### 2. Navigation
#### Definition:
Menus, links, and other tools that help users move through the application or website.

#### Example Contribution:
- A top navigation bar with categories like Home, About, Products, and Contact helps users orient themselves quickly.
- A breadcrumb trail in a wireframe shows how deep a user is within a site’s hierarchy, aiding navigation in large content sites.

#### Why It Matters:
Good navigation reduces user frustration and helps users find content efficiently, enhancing overall experience.

### 3. Content Placement
#### Definition:
Where content such as text, images, videos, and calls to action are located on the page.

#### Example Contribution:
- Hero sections (large banners at the top) for promotions or value propositions grab immediate attention.
- Placing a sign-up form above the fold increases conversion rates.

#### Why It Matters:
Strategic placement improves readability, engagement, and conversion by guiding users to important elements.

### 4. Functionality
#### Definition:
Interactive elements that allow users to perform actions, such as buttons, search fields, forms, or sliders.

#### Example Contribution:
- A search box placed prominently helps users find specific content quickly.
- A filter sidebar on an e-commerce product listing page improves product discovery.

#### Why It Matters:
Functionality transforms static layouts into interactive tools that let users achieve their goals smoothly.

## Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Wireframes
The fidelity of a prototype refers to how closely it resembles the final product in terms of detail, interactivity, and functionality. Both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes serve important roles at different stages of the design process.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Simple, basic representations of a design—often hand-drawn or created with minimal styling. They focus on structure and content placement rather than design details or interactivity.

#### Characteristics
1. Black-and-white or grayscale
2. Uses placeholders (e.g., boxes for images, “Lorem ipsum” for text)
3. No styling or branding
4. Very limited interactivity (if any)
5. May be paper-based or created with basic digital tools (like Balsamiq)

#### When to Use:
1. Early design stages (ideation, planning)
2. Brainstorming and quick iterations
3. Validating layout or flow with stakeholders and team members

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
Detailed and polished wireframes that closely resemble the final product in design, layout, and interactivity

#### Characteristics
1. Pixel-accurate layouts
2. Includes colors, typography, icons, and images
3. Interactive elements (e.g., clickable buttons, simulated navigation)
4. Created with design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, or InVision

#### When to Use:
1. Later stages of design
2. User testing and stakeholder presentations
3. Developer handoff (when specifying final UI details)
